# Meet Kong

*Meet Kong* is a mini game loosely based on [Crazy Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Kong) (I've never played it) using the style of a [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81).

The objective of the game is to move from the bottom of the level to upper floor and say hi to Kong.
