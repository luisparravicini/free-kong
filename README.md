# Meet Kong

**Play it at [itch.io](https://mulitasoft.itch.io/meet-kong)**


*Meet Kong* is a mini game loosely based on [Crazy Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Kong) (I've never played it) using the style of a [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81).

The objective of the game is to move from the bottom of the level to upper floor and say hi to Kong.

## Status

The main objective when developing this game was trying to emulate the look of a ZX81, so it's more a POC than a real game.


There are a lot of small things which may be considered bugs but will stay as they are, such as:

- You can't go down a ladder.
- When the screen is drawing the input is inabled.
- You can't die, so the lives counter is just aesthetics.
